# Student-Performance-Analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes student test performance across math, reading, and writing using a public dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns across demographics and support factors like gender, race, parental education, and test preparation.
The project is divided into two core components: 
SQL Queries to explore and transform the dataset
Tableau Dashboard to visualize key insights and KPIs

# Dataset
Records: 1000 students
Fields: Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Education Level, Test Preparation Course, Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score

#Tools Used:
SQL (Data Analysis)
Tableau (Visualization)

# Tableau Dashboard
* View dashboard on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nkiru.onyemekwu3853/viz/StudentPerformanceDashboard_17532478169660/Dashboard1

Key Features:
Average score breakdowns by subject and demographic
Dynamic filtering by gender, parental education

KPI cards for:
Overall average score
High performer percentage
Test prep score impact
Best performing group

Visual Story Highlights:
Students who complete test prep tend to score higher across all subjects.
Some students from low parental education backgrounds and no prep still outperform the average.
Gender differences in performance are minimal but present.

# Key Takeaway
Preparation matters: Test preparation has a measurable impact on scores.
Education gap exists: Parental education level has an influences student outcomes.
Not all high performance is privileged: Some student groups with low parental education level and no test preparation scored above average. 
Females are out performing the males.

# Recommendation:

Students in these high-performing groups especially the disadvantaged group should be studied more closely, and the findings should inform strategies to help improve outcomes for lower-performing students.
